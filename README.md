## How to use?
#### Step-1 - Copy the source folder into your project
#### Step-2 - Confirm to *"UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate"*
    // Confirm to UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate and implement this method in your view controller.
    extension ViewController : UIPopoverPresentationControllerDelegate {
        func adaptivePresentationStyle(for controller: UIPresentationController) -> UIModalPresentationStyle {
            return .none
        }
    }
#### Step-3 - Create your DataSource
    let item1 = KTItem(id:"1", title:"Item 1", image:#imageLiteral(resourceName: "icon_light"))
    let item2 = KTItem(id:"2", title:"Item 2", image:#imageLiteral(resourceName: "icon_light"))
    let list = [item1,item2]
#### Step-3 - Call showPopupOn method from your view controller
    // Pass the view (sender) where you want to show the popup and your datasource (list)
    showPopupOn(sender, list: list) { (item) in
            print(item.title ?? "")
    }
### BONUS
##### You can also customize the width and other properties of the popup by creating a custom popup like this 

    let vc = KTListPopup.getPopupController()
    vc.width = self.view.frame.width * 0.7
    vc.dataSource = list
    vc.callback = { item in
        print(item.title ?? "")
    }
    showPopupON(sender,vc)
